# MemorEase 

MemorEase is an Android application developed with Kotlin, designed to help users preserve and share their memories — with the help of AI-generated questions. The app features a unique dual-user structure: individuals can save their memories, while relatives can contribute and view them with a dedicated interface. Firebase services and Hugging Face AI models are used for memory management and smart quiz generation.
