# MemorEase 

MemorEase is an Android application developed with Kotlin, designed to help users preserve and share their memories ‚Äî with the help of AI-generated questions. The app features a unique dual-user structure: individuals can save their memories, while relatives can contribute and view them with a dedicated interface. Firebase services and Hugging Face AI models are used for memory management and smart quiz generation.

MemorEase is a Kotlin-based Android application that empowers users to capture, preserve, and interact with their personal memories using text, voice, or images. The app supports two user types ‚Äî individuals and their relatives ‚Äî allowing a shared, collaborative experience centered around memory collection and reflection.

A standout feature is the AI-generated quiz system, which encourages cognitive engagement. Instead of relying on a general-purpose model, the app utilizes a custom fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model, trained specifically to generate relevant and meaningful questions based on user-submitted memories. This allows users to test their recollection, emotional connection, or details surrounding specific events ‚Äî turning memory recall into an interactive and meaningful exercise.

To enhance motivation and engagement, a dynamic leaderboard is integrated into the app. Users earn points through memory uploads and quiz interactions, and rankings are visualized in a clean, competitive layout. Weekly performance reports are also generated in PDF format, providing users with insights into their memory activity over time.

MemorEase is built on Firebase for real-time database syncing, secure authentication, and cloud-based storage. Combined with its custom-trained Hugging Face model and responsive UI, the app provides a holistic experience that merges technology, memory, and emotional connection in a socially interactive platform.
